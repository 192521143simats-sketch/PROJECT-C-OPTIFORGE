/*
 * Carrier invoice reconciliation batch, using integer cents and exact math.
 * DELIBERATE ERROR: replace missingShipmentCount with shipments.size() in main.
 * Correcting that one line permits compilation and a runnable JAR.
 * LegacyLedger intentionally uses raw collections: javac -Xlint:all reports
 * real raw-type/unchecked warnings. Repair them with List<String> and
 * new ArrayList<>() to retain behavior while removing those warnings.
 * Repeated invoice lookup can be replaced with a prebuilt Map for large batches.
 * GRID-X's Java pipeline does not currently rewrite that algorithm or generate
 * an optimized Java source transformation; javac does compile constant values.
