# GRID-X production platform

## Architecture

GRID-X has one React/Vite application, one Fastify coordinator, browser/native worker clients, shared compiler packages, and one authoritative MySQL database. Authentication uses server-side sessions represented by Secure-in-production, HttpOnly, SameSite cookies. The coordinator—not the frontend—enforces ADMIN/USER authorization and artifact ownership.

The domain model separates:

- `distributed_networks`: named, status/expiry/node-limit bounded scheduling domains with a hashed reusable join token.
- `network_enrollments`: one consent and revocable scoped credential per device.
- `nodes`: one browser/native worker identity per enrollment, attached to exactly one network.
- `tasks` and `task_attempts`: network-scoped work with immutable attempt history and bounded retries.
- `compilation_jobs` and `artifacts`: user-owned, network-associated compilation state and downloadable bytes.

Every scheduling query filters nodes by the task's `network_id`; assignment updates additionally require matching network IDs transactionally. Results must match the assigned node, task, and attempt. Workers from one network cannot receive another network's tasks.

## Authentication

Users register with name/email/password. Passwords are Argon2id hashes. Admin identity is bootstrapped from `ADMIN_USERNAME` plus preferably `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH`; `ADMIN_PASSWORD` is development fallback only. Login creates a random session token, stores only its SHA-256 representation in MySQL, and sends the raw token solely in an HttpOnly cookie. Logout/revocation and password reset invalidate sessions.

Password reset tokens are random, short-lived, single-use, and hash-only in MySQL. Without SMTP, development mode returns a local reset link after the same non-enumerating response. Production must connect an email provider and must not return that link in the response.

## Worker types

`BROWSER_WORKER` runs inside a Web Worker. It advertises IR optimization, static analysis, and browser-safe computation. It never claims or attempts GCC, CPython, Java, shell, or operating-system execution. Mobile browsers can suspend tabs, so lost heartbeats cause attempt interruption and requeue.

`NATIVE_WORKER` retains real local C/Python/Java toolchain profiling and compiler execution. It connects with a network/enrollment-scoped bearer credential in the WebSocket handshake header—not a URL. Development can request a native enrollment credential; a signed cross-platform installer is not bundled, so production native deployment still requires packaging/signing work.

## Compiler truthfulness

C uses the custom lexer/parser/semantic model, lowers functions into C-OptiForge IR, distributes meaningful per-function optimization, validates and aggregates candidates, emits C, and invokes GCC for the final native artifact. Browser workers may perform the IR stage; GCC remains native coordinator tooling.

Python uses CPython AST/compiler machinery and produces genuine `.pyc`; Java uses JDK `javac`, `javap`, and `jar` and produces genuine JARs. These require compatible native workers and are not assigned to browser nodes.

## Database migration

Startup performs additive, idempotent MySQL migration for users, auth sessions, reset tokens, networks, enrollments, audit events, ownership/network columns, foreign keys, and indexes. Existing compiler/job data is preserved. Historical `sessions`/`invitations` tables remain only as compatibility history for pre-network installations and are not used by current routes or services. No SQLite code, dependency, or runtime file is present.
