# Native Android verification — 15 October 2026

## Verified checkpoint

Native Kotlin/Compose worker, not a WebView. Uses existing coordinator protocol v1
and MySQL. No coordinator/compiler schema replacement.

- JDK 21.0.12.1, Gradle 8.13, SDK 36, build tools 36.0.0.
- Android JVM tests: 23 passed.
- Debug APK, instrumentation APK, unsigned release APK and release AAB built.
- Root `GRID_X_SANDBOX_TEST=1 npm run verify`: 327 Vitest tests, 16 script tests,
  all nine workspace typechecks and builds passed.
- Xiaomi M2004J19C, Android 10/API 29: both APKs manually installed after Xiaomi
  rejected ADB installation. Installed APK hashes matched local build outputs.
- Physical Keystore, native compute and initial consent tests: 3 passed.
- `npm run verify:artifacts`: passed, isolated fixture `06de8dee7a4aa7b2`;
  migrations, MySQL concurrency, protocol and real C/Python/Java artifact regressions.
- `GRID_X_ANDROID_PREINSTALLED=1 npm run verify:android-native`: passed, isolated
  fixture `bfabc9540fc3388b`. Five real portable task results accepted; C IR
  optimization persisted and verified; coordinator restart; cancellation/reconnect;
  pause/activity recreation/resume; disconnect; leave; authorized artifact downloads.

The initial end-to-end verifier failed because it incorrectly joined IR tasks
directly to job_id. Existing IR tasks are related through optimization batches.
The corrected verifier checks that authoritative relationship and actual phone
attempt ownership; no runtime/compiler behavior was weakened to pass the test.

## Capability and release boundaries

Allowlisted SHA-256, prime counting, hash chains, integer matrix multiplication,
portable benchmark and compatible C IR optimization execute on Android. Desktop
GCC, CPython and JDK are not advertised. Host toolchains generate final artifacts.
Memory/input bounds and cooperative deadlines/cancellation are not a hard OS
heap or CPU sandbox. OS-wide CPU utilization is unavailable and explicitly marked
unavailable; own-process CPU is measured separately.

Release APK/AAB are unsigned; production signing and store approval were not
performed. Physical acceptance covers API 29, not every Android release. Internet
deployment/TLS hosting was not provisioned; device integration used an owned ADB
reverse mapping. No developer database or Docker volume was reset.

## Artifact locations

Under `apps/android-worker/app/build/outputs/`:

- `apk/debug/app-debug.apk`
- `apk/androidTest/debug/app-debug-androidTest.apk`
- `apk/release/app-release-unsigned.apk`
- `bundle/release/app-release.aab`

These generated files are intentionally ignored by Git. Regression test sources
are retained; only the isolated integration runner cleans its owned fixtures.
