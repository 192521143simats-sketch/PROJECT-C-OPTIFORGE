# Explicit user requirement overrides

## 2026-10-16 — Phase9 terminal identity and deployment approval boundary

The new Phase9 master/addendum requires the permanent dark terminal palette
#FF4D2E / #0C0D10 / #FFFFFF / #D9D9D9 across existing platforms, superseding the
earlier Phase8 automatic light/dark choice. Preserve readable system bars and
explicit status/focus states. Existing React, Electron and Material3 components
remain authoritative; do not replace functional screens for decoration.

No provider, domain or authorized Kubernetes cluster exists. The user explicitly
authorizes local implementation, builds, device tests, manifests and setup guides,
but forbids accounts, paid infrastructure and public publishing without separate
approval. Local test transport and mock Kubernetes API contracts never establish
public-internet joining, live containment or development-computer independence.

## 2026-10-15 — Phase7 functional acceptance, not production certification

The user explicitly sets the acceptance bar to the installable Windows app
running and joining as a genuine native node, and requests completion of any
remaining functional requirements without production-only installations or
development. Do not require a new VM, OS features, signing service, compiler
bundle or arbitrary-untrusted-code execution platform to accept this functional
milestone. Stop additional compiler-bundling work and preserve the verified
0.1.1 application; no new system software is installed.

Functional Phase7 acceptance covers installation/upgrade/reinstallation/uninstall,
explicit enrollment and persistent protected identity, protocol-v1 registration,
real supported tasks/results, heartbeat/reconnect/recovery, resource controls,
pause/disconnect/leave/revocation, truthful monitoring and diagnostics. Supported
native C/Python/Java work continues to require compatible installed toolchains
and the existing explicit trusted-development setting. Portable tasks do not.

This is a scope override, not evidence that original production gates passed.
Preserve existing security controls and truthful capability checks. The installer
remains unsigned; fresh-OS certification, bundled native compilers and full
filesystem/network containment remain unclaimed production/extended work. A
functional seal must say "Phase7 functional v1", not imply that the entire
production platform or every Windows machine is certified.

## 2026-10-12 — Reusable default network admission

The user explicitly superseded master M2 R03's single-use-only admission: multiple devices must explicitly consent and join through the same network link while admission is open, subject to the network node limit. Every network has one default link, invoked by default. Admin can revoke/invoke it using a toggle. A revoked link must not enroll and must show an apt expired/unavailable page. Invoking restores the same default URL. Existing enrolled workers remain authenticated; the admission toggle is not node revocation or network disable.

Implementation: append-only MySQL migration 0003, existing NetworkService/admission transactions and existing join page. Keep explicit consent, scoped worker cookies/bearers, stable node IDs, reservation deadline, capability checks and atomic node limits. Retrieval/toggling is admin-only. The default public admission token is stored recoverably for repeated admin copy actions; it is not an admin password or private worker credential. Treat shared links as sensitive admission invitations; keep them out of logs/referrers/analytics. Network expiration/disable still overrides an invoked link.

Previously hashed-only default tokens cannot be recovered. Migration supplies each existing network one fresh default link without changing users, enrolled worker credentials, IDs, jobs or artifacts. Admin retrieves that link after coordinator startup. Old unrecognized links show unavailable; existing single-use invitation API remains compatible but cannot bypass a revoked network admission gate. Historical invitation evidence and frozen migrations 0001/0002 are not rewritten.

This is a bounded user-directed admission change, not permission to redesign compilers, authentication, worker protocols, dashboards or deployment.
