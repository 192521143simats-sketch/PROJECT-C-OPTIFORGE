# Phase 4 recheck and Phase 5 web-foundation evidence

Date: 14 October 2026. Base: 4b75df2, engineering/grid-x-release-foundation.
Runtime: bundled Node 24.21.0. No developer records, schema, credentials or volumes
were changed. No production deployment or external email was performed.

## Actual changes

- Same React/Vite product and existing routes; no new scaffold.
- Server-backed pagination still requests 10/page. Controls are bounded to at most
  nine buttons on large datasets, have accessible current-page names, and disable
  both directions for an empty dataset.
- When records disappear and page totals shrink, the component updates owning
  page state, causing the existing admin effect to request the remaining page.
- Shared HTTP client retains cookie authentication and server application errors;
  malformed JSON and non-JSON responses do not expose response body content.
  All HeadersInit forms are supported rather than relying on object spread.
- Failure/success notices use alert/status roles and React escaping.
- Removed the unused legacy Admin and Dashboard functions; App continues routing
  to the pre-existing AdminV2 and DashboardV2. No user history UI was restored.
- Added jsdom as development-only support for actual React DOM state/click tests.
  These tests are not represented as a physical browser or MySQL UI acceptance.

## Test-first failures and corrections

- Pagination: 3 failures, 4 passes before repair; then 7/7 passed.
- HTTP against a real local HTTP fixture: 2 failures, 2 passes; then 4/4 passed.
- Notice markup: 2 failures, 2 passes; then 4/4 passed.
- Independent read-only review found displayed-page clamping without updating
  owning state. React-DOM regression: page stayed 2 after totalPages became 1
  (1 failed, 1 passed); fix updates owning state (2/2 passed).
- A shell glob filter was passed literally to Vitest, yielding no tests.
  Retried with explicit filenames: both pagination files passed, 9/9 tests.
- npm install reported the existing Argon2 install-script approval warning.
  No blanket script approval was granted. Full existing auth tests/builds passed.

## Fresh final commands

Run from project root with bundled Node on PATH:

```powershell
$env:PATH=(Join-Path (Get-Location) '.runtime/toolchains/node-v24.21.0')+';'+$env:PATH
$env:GRID_X_SANDBOX_TEST='1'
npm test -- --maxWorkers=1
npm run typecheck
node --test scripts/*.test.mjs
npm run build
npm audit --json
node scripts/Run-Isolated-Integration.mjs phase4
git diff --check
```

- Final full suite: **269/269**, 40 files, 103.21 seconds, zero failures/skips.
  Includes real configured GCC/CPython/JDK/compiler and Docker-enabled regressions.
- Typechecks/builds: all eight workspaces passed, including production Vite bundle.
- Script safety/ledger checks: **3/3 passed**.
- npm audit: zero advisories.
- Phase 4 fixture `01a5f49cbddc11a0`: exit 0, real isolated MySQL/coordinator
  restart, cancellation intersecting actual database pause, backoff/deadlines,
  superseded-result rejection, preserved attempts, artifact corruption rejection,
  publication rollback, native catalogue execution, busy policy, admission expiry,
  and isolated backup restore passed. Owned container removed by runner.
- Whitespace check passed (Windows LF/CRLF informational warnings only).

## Review boundary and remaining gates

Independent reviewer checked the uncommitted foundation patch and found the
pagination state bug, now covered by RED-to-GREEN regression and full suite.
The reviewer did not run tests or verify physical browser/cookies/MySQL UI flows;
the main agent ran the commands above. No full Phase 5 acceptance is inferred.

Phase 5 still needs auth pending/error/keyboard journeys, generic owner-scoped
Compute Tasks, complete admin details/live state/settings, configured provider
adapters, and actual browser-to-backend acceptance. No live Resend delivery,
PostHog ingestion, physical browser/mobile or installer/APK success is claimed.
Remaining phases are 6 Browser, 7 Windows, 8 Android, 9 Heterogeneous integration,
10 Security/operations, and 11 Release.

Keep regression test sources, sample programs, runtime dependencies, packages and
database backups. Any cleanup is limited to disposable generated logs from this
run, not arbitrary project files or drive-wide residue.

Cleanup performed: deleted only this run's owned disposable coordinator.log
(6,153 bytes) after checking its resolved path remains inside the project.
The fixture summary, acceptance log and isolated backup were retained. The deleted
log is not recoverable from Git; rerunning the verifier regenerates a new log.
