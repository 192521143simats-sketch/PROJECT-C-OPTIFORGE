# GRID-X native Android worker

Native task contribution has passed physical Android 10 acceptance against an
isolated coordinator/MySQL fixture. See docs/engineering/PHASE8_VERIFICATION.md
for exact evidence and release boundaries; this is not a signed production release.

The app follows the device light/dark setting automatically, including native
window/system-bar colors. It uses paired readable palettes, not blind inversion;
Android force-dark is disabled where supported to avoid double inversion.

Wrapper provenance: Gradle v8.13.0 upstream scripts and wrapper JAR. JAR SHA-256
81a82aaea5abcc8ff68b3dfcb58b3c3c429378efd98e7433460610fecd7ae45f
matched the upstream published checksum during pre-flight. Distribution checksum
is enforced by gradle-wrapper.properties.

## Reproducible local build

Use JDK 21 (not Android Studio's JDK 25 with Gradle 8.13), Android SDK platform36
and build-tools36.0.0. Configure ANDROID_HOME externally or ignored local.properties.

```powershell
$env:JAVA_HOME='C:/Program Files/Java/jdk-21.0.12.1'
$env:ANDROID_HOME='D:/Android/Sdk'
./gradlew.bat :app:testDebugUnitTest :app:assembleDebug :app:assembleRelease :app:bundleRelease --no-daemon
```

Debug APK: app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk. Release output is unsigned
unless an explicit external signing identity is configured. Never publish a debug
APK as a production-signed application. No signing credentials belong in Git.

## Permissions and trust boundaries

INTERNET: coordinator API/WebSocket; ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE: contribution policy.
FOREGROUND_SERVICE/SPECIAL_USE: user-initiated visible distributed contribution;
POST_NOTIFICATIONS: ongoing contribution controls on supported versions.
No contacts, microphone, location, external storage or shell execution is needed.
Special-use foreground service distribution requires platform/store review; this
repository cannot promise that review's outcome. No automatic boot contribution.

Release traffic requires HTTPS/WSS with ordinary certificate validation. Debug
supports explicit development HTTP including ADB reverse; credentials on HTTP
are unsuitable for an untrusted network. Localhost on a phone means the phone,
not the PC, unless a specific ADB reverse mapping exists.

Only bounded allowlisted portable tasks can execute natively. Android is not a
desktop GCC/CPython/JDK host. Results are checked by the coordinator; neither
task completion nor compilation artifacts are fabricated by the Android UI.
